## TODO, in no specific order
- ssh client
- cli args
- more update cycle options
- change colors
- show current algo
- refactor algos to be detached from core (function type that passes grid and buffer not relies on it)
- dynamic cell creation (select type of cell via click count) (dynamic color toggle on number of press)
